TODO:
    parsing improvements:
        - unify macro approach (or define grammar combinators), remove hardcoded bits
        - specify ast schema, add validation (subclasses?)
        - very inefficient, can we improve? side effect of naive rec-desc?
        - handle more binary operators
        - correct operator precedence - use parser?
        - multithread imports and late binding / linker stage at end
        X handle single-argument functions
        - handle chained postfix operators  eg hof()(), aoa[1][2]
        - find a good way of checking exhaustively for ambiguities (and even for resolving them)
            - ordering of TRY is significant in causing ambiguities
            - during parsing, when ambiguity is resolved, can use to generate very specific error messages
            - for now, should be able to:
                - generate error messages at a block level when an incorrect program_part is detected
                - then skip to end of block somehow and attempt to resume
        - error messages

    syntax:
        - can we omit brackets for function literals?

    reference vm:
        X intern functions (source code can only contain so many functions :D)
        - strings a bit useless
        - print() semantically broken: a = print; a("hello world")
            - will tie in with integrating c functions
        - bytecode generation
            - then can cache bytecodes between runs

    jitter:
        - extension of the rvm

    features:
        X strings
        - arrays
        - if/else
        - looping
        - comments
        - imports
        - custom data structures
        - static typing, type safety, automatic deduction
        - stdlib
            - math
            - strings
            - collections
            - io
            - ffi / syscall
        - closure

    other:
        - some unit tests!!
        - fix the REPL
            - make the top-level parse a program-part
            - evaluate as we go
            - handle multilines nicely
