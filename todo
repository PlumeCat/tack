TODO:
    parsing improvements:
        - handle more binary operators
        - correct operator precedence
        - handle chained postfix operators  eg hof()(), aoa[1][2]
        X handle single-argument functions
        X index operator
        - multithread imports
        - error messages

    parser:
        - get rid of the "success" blocks; should be able to accomplish with optionals or always return ast & throw failure approach
        - very inefficient, can we improve? side effect of naive rec-desc?
            - nested TRY will help with this; (eg, see parse_if_exp)
        - unify macro approach (or define grammar combinators), remove hardcoded bits
            - do some kind of general looping / greedy parser
            - ALL parsing rules should be macro'd
        - specify ast schema, add validation (subclasses?)
        - find a good way of checking exhaustively for ambiguities (and even for resolving them)
            - ordering of TRY is significant in causing ambiguities
            - during parsing, when ambiguity is resolved, can use to generate very specific error messages
            - for now, should be able to:
                - generate error messages at a block level when an incorrect program_part is detected
                - then skip to end of block somehow and attempt to resume

    syntax:
        - can we omit brackets for function literals?

    reference vm:
        X intern functions (source code can only contain so many functions :D)
        - lists and strings a bit useless
        - print() semantically broken:
            a = print; a("hello world") should work but won't
            - will tie in with integrating c functions
        - bytecode generation
            - then can cache bytecodes between runs

    jitter:
        - extension of the reference vm

    features:
        X strings
        X arrays
        - if/else
        - looping
        - comments
        - custom data structures
        - imports
        - static typing, type safety, automatic deduction
        - stdlib
            - math
            - strings
            - collections
            - io: std-in/out, files, paths, network
            - os, syscall, ffi
            - threads, async, futures
        - closure

    other:
        - some unit tests!!
        - fix the REPL
            - make the top-level parse a program-part
            - evaluate as we go
            - handle multilines nicely
